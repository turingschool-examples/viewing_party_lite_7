What we have today is not the glory that he once was.\r \r But, beyond the great return of funny Eddie...there is a wonderful dark humor that goes great with an otherwise wholesome and moving moral.")
    expect(page).to have_content("CinemaSerf: Poor old ogre \"Shrek\" just want to be left alone, that's all - he's got a bit of the Greta Garbo's about him. Rather inconveniently, though, nasty Lord \"Farquaad\" who has a little of the Napoleon syndrome about him, banishes all the fairytale creatures from his lands and so they turn up on the doorstep of our green friend. How can he be rid of them all? Well together with his new (and frankly quite annoying friend) \"Donkey\" they head to the castle where they are given challenge: go and rescue the Princess \"Fiona\" from her dragon-guarded castle tower and bring her to marry the diminutive dictator. Off they go on a series of fun escapades that introduce us to all the creatures in the forest - including a decidedly French \"Robin Hood , \"Pinocchio\", \"Peter Pan\" - indeed, just about everyone from the fables pantheon. Do they achieve their mission - we you will just have to watch and see; but along the way the jokes have plenty to amuse older audiences with a screenplay that pokes some gentle fun at some prevailing stereotypes on beauty, loyalty, bullying, sexuality - you name it. Murphy is still fearsomely annoying - sorry, but Messrs. Myers, Lithgow and Cassel along with Cameron Diaz add richness to the punchy script and to the excellent and enjoyably colourful animation to create a film that has stood the test of time well.")
