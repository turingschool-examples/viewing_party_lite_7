### Scott DeVoss Contribution

- Approach
This was an enjoyable project to work on with Cory. I thought we did a good job in the DTR of planning out how to approach problems when we get stuck and sticking to them.
We paired most of the project especially when we got to the more complex API user stories. I thought this was the best plan of attack and I felt like I was able to learn a lot bouncing ideas off one another. We complimented one another nicely. Cory did a great job of leading the charge on the facade and poros lesson which really helped me get a better understanding of how they all interact. It took us a little bit to get up and going but once we started seeing successful API calls, things started to click.

- My Contributions
As far as my contributions go, I thought I did a good job of taking charge and utilizing Postman and exploring the TMDB website for more information on how to get a successful API call. It was a big trial and error approach that definitely took some time but I think it helped learn how to read and apply documentation which is one of the main learning objectives I want to continue to focus on in this mod. From there, we were both able to reference google and lesson plans to slowly piece together the correct API functionality.
I had a large impact on the test writing and while I definitely think some tests can be more robust, we were able to test the main functionality in the time we had. Also, testing poros, services and facades was new to us and we both had a helping hand working together to make sure we checked that box.
I provided good organization and strong attention to detail that was displayed multiple times throughout the project. There were many instances where we were stuck for a bit and I was able to find a few silly mistakes that were an easy fix in the end and saved time.

- Code
I am most proud of the way we were both able to implement poros, services and facades with little to no experience. We both utilized the docs, lesson plans and mentors to help us get to where we needed to be while also doing a lot of trial and error. Being able to pass our tests through what seemed to be so many moving pieces was very rewarding to see.
What I am curious about are our controllers. Is it ok to have many different variables to call on in our controllers? Whats a good limit to keep under? Also, we have a .count in there that we weren't quite sure where else to put? Maybe a model?
If we had more time, we would have like to learn more about testing the facade - we only were able to add one test to it and weren't sure what else to do. Also, we would also like to use WebMock and VCR. We were making API calls every time which I know isn't good practice we just didn't get a chance to add it at the pace we were working.
Overall, I am happy with this project and I feel like we both learned a lot in less than a week. Unfortunately I had to miss a day but there are so many good take aways and I feel like I am in a good spot to start Mod 3.
